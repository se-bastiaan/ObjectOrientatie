# Object Orientation 2014-2015

This repository contains solutions (each in a different branch) for the execises of the Object Orientation course of the Radboud University.
Quality is not guaranteed, especially the last weeks are rush projects. And I hate Swing. But the code might help you solve your own exercises.
